# OET Visualisation Requirements

A repo to gather requirements for visualisation across OET projects

## Context

Open Energy Transition is interested in coordinating existing, and contributing to existing and new
development efforts for the visualisation of PyPSA networks, inputs, results and workflows.

Taken in the broadest sense, this covers all aspects of a (hypothetical) PyPSA Graphical User Interface,
but in the immediate term, will focus on the visualisation of PyPSA results.

At present, we are interested in gathering user stories related to visualisation of PyPSA networks.
Please follow the instructions below to add your ideas, requirements and requests. 
Tangible, specific examples with clear rationale, illustrations or an image are much appreciated!

We are also interested in compiling a list of existing projects which focus on visualisation, such as
[PyPSA-Explorer](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/PyPSA-Explorer)...

## Instructions

Add your user story as a [new issue](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/oet-viz-reqs/issues/new?template=user-story.md). Follow the instructions in the issue template.

Be careful! This repository is public, so please ensure that you do not upload private data or results by accident, for example by sharing example visualisations from a project.
